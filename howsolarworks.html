<h2>Charge controller</h2>
<p>
	<em>Charge controllers are crucial in BIPV systems to prevent batteries from being damaged by overcharging and over-discharging by controlling the current flow from and to the batteries. They can also protect the appliances that are connected to the batteries in BIPV systems. Most batteries can hardly recover after overcharging and over-discharging, so the employment of controllers in BIPV systems can prolong the service life of the batteries. There are various types of charge controllers, including shunt controls, single-stage controls, multistage controls, etc.</em>

<h2>Solar panels</h2>
<p>
	<em>Solar energy begins with the sun. Solar panels (also known as "PV panels") are used to convert light from the sun, which is composed of particles of energy called "photons", into electricity that can be used to power electrical loads.The development of solar energy goes back more than 100 years. In the early days, solar energy was used primarily for the production of steam which could then be used to drive machinery.</em>

<h2>Battery system</h2>
<p>
<em>Battery system stores surplus solar power for later use. The solar battery extends the use of a PV-system’s generated energy and will provide free, sustainable power even when the sun is not shining and the panels don’t produce energy.Therefore, with a solar battery little to no electricity is fed into the grid while also avoiding having to buy expensive electricity from the grid later</em>

<h2>What is Inverter?</h2>
<article class="article-left">
<h2>Inverter</h2>
<p>
<em>An inverter is a power supply that converts DC into AC. A common unit converts 12 V from a car battery into standard 120 V 60 Hz AC. With an inverter you can operate common household lights and appliances from a battery.A special variation of an inverter is the uninterruptible power supply (UPS). These are widely used with computers and networks to provide power even during loss of AC input from the power line.</em>

<h2>DC power</h2>
<p>
<em>Direct current is the one directional or unidirectional flow of electric charge. An electrochemical cell is a prime example of DC power. Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams</em>

<h2>AC power</h2>
<p>
<em>Alternating current (AC) is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time in contrast to direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electrical energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions, fans and electric lamps into a wall socket.The usual waveform of alternating current in most electric power circuits is a sine wave, whose positive half-period corresponds with positive direction of the current and vice versa.</em>
